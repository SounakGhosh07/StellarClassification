# StellarClassification

We have created an ensemble based approach to weighted ensembling-based approach to predict the type of 
stellar â€“ Galaxy, Star, or Quasar based on the features collected. Our approach 
aims at utilizing the different features extracted by different classifiers, to 
eliminate any possible bias due to the usage of a single classifier
